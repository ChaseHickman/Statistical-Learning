Understanding Regression Coefficients with Multiple Predictors and
Interactions
================

### Predictive vs Counterfactual Interpretations of Coefficients

##### Predictive

> The response, on average, comparing **two individuals** *holding all
> other predictors constant*. This is not always logistically possible
> when predictors co-vary or interact with each other.

##### Counterfactual

> The response **associated** with a 1 unit change to an
> **individualâ€™s** predictor. This suggests causality and may be
> inappropriate.
